# Agentic-Workflow

My tailored development + agentic-workflow setup, in code — so a fresh Mac is one
command away from feeling like home.

It covers the terminal stack (WezTerm + Starship, `rose-pine-moon` theme) and a
seven-tool agentic toolchain, and will grow to cover the rest of my workflow.

## Quick start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/zachmarmolejo/Agentic-Workflow.git
cd Agentic-Workflow
./install.sh
```

Then open a new WezTerm window (or `source ~/.zshrc`).

`install.sh` is safe to re-run — it's idempotent and backs up any file it would
overwrite to `<file>.bak.<timestamp>`.

## What's inside

| Area | Tool | What it gives you |
|------|------|-------------------|
| Terminal | [WezTerm](https://wezfurlong.org/wezterm/) | `rose-pine-moon` theme, Hack Nerd Font, 80% opacity + macOS background blur, rose-tinted tab bar that hides on a single tab |
| Prompt | [Starship](https://starship.rs/) | blue dir · gray git branch · yellow command-duration · purple `❯` |
| Font | Hack Nerd Font | glyphs/icons the prompt relies on |
| Editor | [Neovim](https://neovim.io/) + [LazyVim](https://lazyvim.org/) | rose-pine-moon (transparent to match), LSP · completion · telescope · treesitter |

## What `install.sh` does

1. Installs Homebrew if missing, then installs everything in `Brewfile`.
2. Symlinks the configs into place (so edits in this repo are live):
   - `config/wezterm/wezterm.lua` → `~/.config/wezterm/wezterm.lua`
   - `config/starship.toml` → `~/.config/starship.toml`
   - `config/nvim/` → `~/.config/nvim/` (LazyVim)
   - `config/agents/AGENTS.md` → `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`, `~/AGENTS.md`, `~/.codex/AGENTS.md`
   - `config/skills/agentflow/` → `~/.claude/skills/agentflow/` (the `/agentflow` skill)
3. Appends the Starship init line to `~/.zshrc` (only if not already there).

## Agentic toolchain

Beyond the terminal, this repo installs Kun Chen's agentic toolchain — seven
tools that compose into one workflow but each run standalone. Installed via the
`Brewfile`, `setup/skills.sh` (Claude Code skills), and `setup/tools.sh` (CLI
binaries + the firstmate clone).

| # | Tool | What it does | Run it |
|---|------|--------------|--------|
| 1 | OpenSuperWhisper | Push-to-talk dictation in any text field | menu bar |
| 2 | [AXI](https://axi.md) | Principles for agent-ergonomic CLIs (reference skill) | `/axi` |
| 3 | lavish | Open agent HTML artifacts for click-to-annotate feedback | `/lavish` · `lavish-axi` |
| 4 | no-mistakes | AI gate: push → review/test/lint/docs → clean PR | `git push no-mistakes` |
| 5 | gnhf | Bounded autonomous loop (one committed change per iteration) | `gnhf "objective"` |
| 6 | treehouse | Reusable isolated git worktree pool for parallel agents | `treehouse` |
| 7 | firstmate | Talk to one agent; it runs a crew in tmux and hands you PRs | `cd ~/firstmate && claude` |

**→ [docs/tools.md](docs/tools.md) — how to run each tool in isolation.**

> **Note — `axi` is a reference / build-time skill, not a daily driver.** It
> teaches the agent the AXI principles for building agent-ergonomic CLIs and
> only fires when you're *authoring or reviewing a CLI* (e.g. wrapping a
> security tool for agent use). Kept on purpose: near-zero cost (one lazy-loaded
> `SKILL.md`) and the foundation the other AXI tools (`lavish`, `no-mistakes`,
> `gh-axi`) build on.

## Global agent instructions

One file, every agent. `config/agents/AGENTS.md` holds my global agent rules and
is symlinked to all three targets so they never drift:

- `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` — Claude Code (loaded into every session)
- `~/AGENTS.md` — the cross-agent [AGENTS.md](https://agents.md) standard
- `~/.codex/AGENTS.md` — Codex

Edit `config/agents/AGENTS.md` once and every agent picks it up. It can point to
optional on-demand companions: `~/OPINIONS.md` (viewpoints) and `~/VOICE.md`
(writing voice).

## Neovim cheat sheet

LazyVim, leader = `<Space>`. Neovim is **modal** — that's the part that trips
people up. Press `<Space>` and pause anytime to get the which-key menu.

**→ Also at [docs/nvim.md](docs/nvim.md)** — open from inside nvim with `:e ~/Agentic-Workflow/docs/nvim.md`.

**Modes**

| Key | Mode |
|-----|------|
| `i` / `a` | insert — type text |
| `<Esc>` | back to **normal** mode (stop editing) |
| `v` | visual — select |
| `:` | command line |

**Get out / around**

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `<Space>h` | back to the dashboard (custom keymap) |
| `<Space>` then wait | which-key menu — shows everything |
| `:w` · `:q` · `:wq` | save · quit window · save+quit |
| `<Space>qq` | quit all |

**Buffers (open files)**

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `<Space>,` | list / switch buffers |
| `<Space>bb` | switch to previous buffer |
| `<Space>bd` | close current buffer |
| `<Space>bD` | close buffer + window |

**Windows / splits**

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `<Space>-` · `<Space>\|` | split below · split right |
| `<C-h/j/k/l>` | move between splits |
| `<Space>wd` | close current split |
| `<C-w>o` | unsplit — close all *other* splits |

**Files & search**

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `<Space>ff` | find files |
| `<Space>/` | grep in project |
| `<Space>e` | file explorer |
| `<Space>fn` | new file |

## Roadmap

- [x] Terminal stack (WezTerm + Starship, rose-pine-moon)
- [x] Agentic toolchain (OpenSuperWhisper · AXI · lavish · no-mistakes · gnhf · treehouse · firstmate)
- [ ] Desktop wallpaper (lakeside pagoda at sunset — see `assets/`)
- [x] Neovim (LazyVim, rose-pine-moon)
- [ ] Security-lab tooling (wrap recon/scan CLIs as AXI tools)
